A collection of reddit bots and utilities by /u/GoldenSights. I no longer write new bots.

## Requirements

* Python3
* Python modules: `requirements.txt`

## Before running any bots

**Use descriptive useragents**. Include a username by which admins can identify you. Tell what your bot is doing and why. Convince the admins that you aren't wasting their bandwidth. Inadequate useragents may cause your bot to get logged out in the middle of your session, and the program will crash. Abusive useragents can get your bot shadowbanned.

## Bot.py

To standardize and simplify authentication, all bots rely on `bot.py`. Please download my copy and follow the instructions.
